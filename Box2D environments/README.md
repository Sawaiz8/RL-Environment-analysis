## Car Racing
### What did I not understand?
I don't understan why does the car stops in the middle after getting off track. I have to understand why.
I don't get is the reward function so weird why doesn't it penalize heavily when it gets out of the bounds.
### What did I learn new?
It takes a significant training iterations to get good results. About 425k to get around 500. About a million to get 900
